# Watiqaty Platform

## Overview

Watiqaty is an AI-powered platform designed to assist Moroccans with their administrative paperwork. The platform leverages an advanced chatbot equipped with ADAPTIVE Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to guide users through the process of obtaining necessary documents and filling out forms.

## Walkthrough of the ADAPTIVE RAG Pipeline

ADAPTIVE RAG combines the power of retrieval-augmented generation with adaptive mechanisms to provide more accurate and context-relevant responses. Here's how the pipeline works:
1. **Query Processing**: The user's query is processed to understand the context and intent.
2. **Document Retrieval**: Relevant documents and past interactions are retrieved based on the query.
3. **Answer Generation**: The model generates responses using the retrieved information, ensuring high relevance and accuracy.
4. **Adaptation**: The model adapts to new information and user feedback, continuously improving over time.

## Benchmarking

Here is a comparative table of ADAPTIVE RAG with other models based on several criteria:

| Model          | Accuracy | Speed | Scalability | Cost-Efficiency |
|----------------|:--------:|:-----:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| ADAPTIVE RAG   |    ✔️    |   ✔️   |      ✔️     |       ✔️       |
| Model 2        |    ✔️    |   ❌   |      ✔️     |       ❌       |
| Model 3        |    ❌    |   ✔️   |      ❌     |       ✔️       |
